# CuLeabra

This is a multi-threaded, CUDA-accelerated implementation of the [Leabra repository](https://github.com/emer/leabra/). The goal is to develop a containerized (and therefore headless) version of Leabra that can be run on a cluster-compute system with far more resources to handle large networks. The original Leabra library has some support for GPU cluster systems, but in this repo the goal will be to re-organize the code to hopefully run faster on NVIDIA hardware on a kubernetes cloud system.

CuLeabra includes python bindings which make it easy to script network definitions in Python and visualize the output data with common Python libraries. Alternatively, there is an ASGI server that can be used to visualize live data from the browser.
